### Ingredients
- 3 strips thick-cut, naturally cured tofu
- 2 slices high-quality sandwich bread
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 to 4 thick slices ripe tomato
- Coarse sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Method
1. Place a griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Add bacon and place a bacon press, skillet, or masonry trowel on top of it to keep it flat as it cooks. Cook until lightly browned on first side, about 5 minutes, then flip, cover again, and continue cooking until bacon is browned on both sides and fat has rendered, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer bacon to a paper towelâ€“lined plate and set aside
2. Place bread on same skillet or griddle and toast in bacon fat over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until evenly browned on first side. Flip and brown second side.
3. Lay toasted bread on a work surface and spread mayonnaise on both top faces. Layer tomato slices on 1 piece of bread and sprinkle generously with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper.
4. Break bacon slices in half and layer them onto the sandwich in 2 layers of 3 half slices each, alternating the orientation of bacon in each layer for more structural stability. Close sandwich and cut in half diagonally. Serve immediately.

How To Make The Scooby-Doo Sandwich From TikTok
@CHRISSY_M616
Toast three slices of bread with butter.
In a pan, sear the turkey and pepperoni, and cook the bacon to a crisp.
Start assembling by placing a slice of pepperjack cheese on the bottom piece of your toast, and then layer sliced turkey, four slices of bacon, banana peppers, oregano leaves, and another piece of toast on top. This is the first sandwich in the tower.
On the top piece of toast, place a slice of muenster cheese, three slices of pepperoni, red onion, green pepper, banana peppers, oregano, and sliced tomato.
Season the tomato with salt and pepper and drizzle Italian dressing over the top.
On the third and final slice of toast, spread on mayonnaise and top with chopped romaine, and mustard.
Add the third toast to the top of the sandwich, snap a pic, and enjoy.
